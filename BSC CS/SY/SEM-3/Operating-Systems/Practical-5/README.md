## Problem Statement
<p>The shortest job first (SJF) or shortest job next, is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next. SJN, also known as Shortest Job Next (SJN), can be preemptive or non-preemptive. </p>

<p>This Algorithm is non preemptive</p>

<br>

## The Algorithm

1. Start
2. Initialize an list processes = [] to store all the processes.
3. Select a process for the processes list which has the shortest burst time and execute that process.
4. Repeat Step(3) until the processes list is empty.
5. End
