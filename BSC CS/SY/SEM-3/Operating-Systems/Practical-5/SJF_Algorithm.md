## Problem Statement
<p>The shortest job first (SJF) or shortest job next, is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next. SJN, also known as Shortest Job Next (SJN), can be preemptive or non-preemptive. </p>

<p>This Algorithm is non preemptive</p>
