<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>A thread is the smallest unit of a program or process executed independently or scheduled by the Operating System. In the computer system, an Operating System achieves multitasking by dividing the process into threads. A thread is a lightweight process that ensures the execution of the process separately on the system. when multiple processors are running on a program, each processor runs simultaneously to execute its tasks separately.</p>
