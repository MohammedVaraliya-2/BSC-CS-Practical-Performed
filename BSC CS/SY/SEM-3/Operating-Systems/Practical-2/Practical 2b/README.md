## Problem Statement

<p>A thread is the smallest unit of a program or process executed independently or scheduled by the Operating System. In the computer system, an Operating System achieves multitasking by dividing the process into threads. A thread is a lightweight process that ensures the execution of the process separately on the system. when multiple processors are running on a program, each processor runs simultaneously to execute its tasks separately.</p>

## The Algorithm

1. Start. 
2. Initialize or write the method.
3. Initialize the necessary number of threads. 
4. Assing one method per thread.  
5. Run thread. 
6. End.
