                <p><b>Introduction</b><br>Memories are timeless treasures of the heart. When I think of the my past, It
                    gives me tons of happiness. Each one of us have some important moments to think. They stay in our
                    heart for years and years. I would like to share my treasurable moments with my friends.</p>

                <p><b>My Childhood days</b><br>When I was a kid, my father used to carry me in his bicycle. I used to
                    sit in the front of the cycle and travel to get the milk during the early morning. He drives me to
                    school and then we used chat till late night. Also every weekend, we leave to our grandma's home.
                    She used to prepare chicken and my favorite sweets. We eat well and roam around our farm and came
                    back by night with our grandfather.</p>

                <p><b>School Days</b><br>The first day when I stepped into the school was an unforgettable thing. I
                    cried and ran away from the school gate saying that I will not go to school. After a long
                    compromise, I went to school. But starting of each week, that is on Monday, I used to struggle my
                    parents to apply for leave. But when I think now, it is fully childish.
                    <br>As days went by, I got used to school and had some interest in studies. So I leave to school
                    early and finish my all works. This is the way I got used to punctuality at least for few occasions.
                    I had interest in drawing. My teachers supported me in bringing up my talents. I used to participate
                    in school competitions but somehow I would win a prize at the last.
