        <h5><u> The Person Who Has Made a Difference in My Life </u></h5>
        <p> The Person Who Has Made a Difference in My LifeWhen I think about “the person who has made a difference in my life” , the firstperson in my mind is my mother. She taught me a lot of things, and the most importantthing is she made me want to become a successful businessman. When I was young, mymother told me about life, the best way to live and become a good man. She is really themost influential person in my life. Growing up and seeing my mother owning andrunning a successful store helped put direction in my life. She was the one who taught mehow to run a successful business and taught me several key points to having a business.One of her keys to having a successful business was to always provide excellent customerservice and to satisfy each and every customer. Seeing my mother as a successfulbusinesswoman has made me aspire to have my own business one day. Although she is abusy manager in her company and her own business, my mother still has time to take careof my family. My mother always is my idol. As I look back at the things I have done islife, it would not have been possible without having someone special like my mother inmy life. She has given me endless support and love. I am very thankful and blessed toknow my mother has made a difference in my life.
