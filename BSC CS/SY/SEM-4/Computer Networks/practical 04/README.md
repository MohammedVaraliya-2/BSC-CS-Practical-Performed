#### Aim: 
    Using Packet Tracer, create a basic network of one server and two computers
    and two mobile / movable devices using appropriate network wire. And verify the
    connectivity

#### Theory:
    A Wireless Access Point (WAP) is a networking device that allows wirelesscapable devices to connect to a wired network. Instead of using wires and cables to
    connect every computer or device in the network, installing WAPs is a more
    convenient, more secure, and cost-efficient alternative.

    Setting up a wireless network provides a lot of advantages and benefits for you and
    your small business.

        1) It is easier to set up compared to setting up a wired network.
        2) It is more convenient to access.
        3) It is less complicated to add new users in the network.
        4) It gives users more flexibility to stay online even when moving from one
           area in the office to another.
        5) Guest users can have Internet access by just using a password.
        6) Wireless network protection can be set up even if the network is visible to
           the public by configuring maximum wireless security.
        7) Segmentation of users, such as guests and employees, is possible by creating
           Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) to protect your network resources
           and assets.

    There are different purposes of setting up a wireless network using a WAP.
    With a WAP, the following can be done:

        1) Create a wireless network within your existing wired network.
        2) Extend the signal range and strength of your wireless network to provide
           complete wireless coverage and get rid of dead spots especially in larger
           office spaces or buildings.
        3) Accommodate wireless devices within a wired network.
        4) Configure the settings of your wireless access points in one device.
