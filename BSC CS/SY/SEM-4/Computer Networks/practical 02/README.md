#### Aim: 
    Using Packet Tracer, create a basic network of two computers using appropriate
    network wire. Use Static IP address allocation and show connectivity

#### Theory:
    For assigning ip addresses dynamically we use the DHCP protocol

    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client/server protocol that
    automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other
    related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway.

    The DHCP server maintains a pool of IP addresses and leases an address to any
    DHCP-enabled client when it starts up on the network. Because the IP addresses
    are dynamic (leased) rather than static (permanently assigned), addresses no
    longer in use are automatically returned to the pool for reallocation.

    DHCP provides the following benefits.
        1)  Reliable IP address configuration. DHCP minimizes configuration errors
            caused by manual IP address configuration, such as typographical errors, or
            address conflicts caused by the assignment of an IP address to more than
            one computer at the same time.

        2)  Reduced network administration. DHCP includes the following features to
            reduce network administration
            DHCP runs at the application layer of the Transmission Control Protocol/IP
            (TCP/IP) stack to dynamically assign IP addresses to DHCP clients and to
            allocate TCP/IP configuration information to DHCP clients. This includes
            subnet mask information, default gateway IP addresses and domain name
            system (DNS) addresses.
