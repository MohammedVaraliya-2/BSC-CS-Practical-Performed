### Ping

    Ping is a command-line utility, available on virtually any operating
    system with network connectivity, that acts as a test to see if a
    networked device is reachable.

    The ping command sends a request over the network to a specific
    device. A successful ping results in a response from the computer that
    was pinged back to the originating computer

### Traceroute

    Traceroute is a utility that records the Internet route (gateway
    computers at each hop) between your computer and a specified
    destination computer. It also calculates and displays the amount of
    time for each hop. 
    
    This utility helps you find where high transfer
    times are occurring in your internal network and the Internet. Before
    using Traceroute, you can use the Ping utility to identify whether a
    host is present on the network.

### Netstat

    Netstat provides statistics about all active connections so you can find out
    which computers or networks a PC is connected to. You can use the network
    tool for Windows, Linux, and macOS conveniently via the command line

### Arp

    ARP Command is a TCP/IP utility and Microsoft Windows
    command for viewing and modifying the local Address
    Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache, which contains recently
    resolved MAC addresses of Internet Protocol (IP) hosts on the
    network. 
    
    When one host on a TCP/IP network wants to
    communicate with a second host, the first host begins by
    using the ARP to resolve the IP address of the second host
    into its associated MAC address. The MAC address is needed
    for communication to take place over the network.

### Ipconfig

    ipconfig is a command line tool in Windows and other operating
    systems that displays the current configuration of network
    interfaces. 
    
    It can be used to view and release DHCP leases, renew
    DHCP leases, and flush the DNS resolver cache. 
    
    The command can also be used to display the IP address, subnet mask, and default
    gateway of a computer. The equivalent command in Linux and
    macOS is "ifconfig".

### Getmac

    The getmac command is a command line tool in Windows that displays the Media Access
    Control addresses of the network adapters installed on a computer. 
    
    The getmac command can be executed by opening the Command Prompt and typing «getmac» followed by any
    relevant switches or options.

### hostname

    A hostname is a unique name that is assigned to a device connected to a network. 
    
    The hostname command is a command line tool in Windows and other operating systems that
    can be used to display the hostname of the computer. 
    
    The equivalent command in Linux and macOS is «hostnamectl» or «hostname»

### NSLookUp

    NSLookup (short for "name server lookup") is a command-line tool that allows users to
    query Domain Name System (DNS) servers for information about hostnames and IP
    addresses. 
    
    It is used to troubleshoot DNS-related issues by providing detailed information
    about the DNS records associated with a specified domain or IP address. 
    
    NSLookup can be
    used to perform both forward and reverse DNS lookups, and it is available on most
    operating systems.

### pathping

    Pathping is a command-line tool in Windows that allows users to
    perform a more detailed version of the traditional ping command. 
    
    It sends a series of pings to each hop along the path to a specified
    destination and then provides statistics about the packet loss and
    response time for each hop.

### SystemInfo

    The systeminfo command is a command-line tool that displays system
    information for a Windows computer. 
    
    It provides detailed information about the computer's hardware and software configuration, 
    including the version of the operating system, the amount of installed memory,
    the processor type and speed, and the names and versions of installed
    drivers and hotfixes.
