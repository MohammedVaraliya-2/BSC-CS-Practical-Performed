<br>

## Practical 1

    Using, linux-terminal or Windows-cmd, execute following networking commands and note the 
    output: ping, traceroute, netstat, arp, ipconfig, Getmac,hostname, NSLookUp, pathping, SystemInfo

## Practical 2

    Using Packet Tracer, create a basic network of two computers using appropriate network wire. 
    Use Static IP address allocation and show connectivity

## Practical 3

    Using Packet Tracer, create a basic network of One server and two computers using appropriate network wire. 
    Use Dynamic IP address allocation and show connectivity

## Practical 4

    Using Packet Tracer, create a basic network of One server and two computers and 
    two mobile / movable devices using appropriate network wire. Show connectivity

## Practical 5

    Using Packet Tracer to create a network with three routers with RIPv1 and
    each router associated network will have minimum three PC and show the
    connectivity

## Practical 6

    Using Packet Tracer to create a network with three routers with RIPv2 and
    each router associated network will have minimum three PC and show the
    connectivity

## Practical 7

    Using Packet Tracer, create a network with three routers with OSPF and
    each router associated network will have minimum three PC and show
    Connectivity

## Practical 8

    Using Packet Tracer, create a network with three routers with BGP and each router 
    associated network will have minimum three PC. Show Connectivity

## Practical 9

    Using Packet Tracer, create a wireless network of multiple PCs using appropriate 
    access point.

## Practical 10

    Using Wireshark, network analyzer, set the filter for ICMP, TCP, HTTP, UDP, FTP 
    and perform respective protocol transactions to show/prove that the network analyzer is 
    working
