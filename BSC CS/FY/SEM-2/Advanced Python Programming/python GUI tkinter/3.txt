Leo Messi

Lionel Messiâ€”probably the best player in the world today. 
He is one of the finest and most exciting footballing talents in the world. 
He had this never ending comparison with the former Manchester 
United Winger Cristiano Ronaldo but he kind of shrugged 
off it by helping his team defeat Manchester 
United convincingly in the UEFA Champions League finals at Rome 2009.
