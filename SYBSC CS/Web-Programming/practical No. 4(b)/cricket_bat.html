        <p><b>A cricket bat is a specialised piece of equipment used by batters in the sport of cricket to hit the ball, typically consisting of a cane handle attached to a flat-fronted willow-wood blade. It may also be used by a batter who is making ground to avoid a run out, by holding the bat and touching the ground with it.</b>

            <h3>What is a cricket bat made of?</h3>
            <li><b>English willow <br> <br>
                The Bats. Shaped something like a paddle, cricket bats are traditionally made of English willow. Light in weight while also tough and shock resistant, willow resists denting or splintering on impact with a ball travelling at high speed.</b></li>
