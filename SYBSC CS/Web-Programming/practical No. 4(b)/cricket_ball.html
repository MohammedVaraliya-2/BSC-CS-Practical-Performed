            <h3>What is cricket ball made of?</h3>
            <li><b>In its most common form, a cricket ball is made from layers of twine wound around a cork core, inside a red leather shell. A raised seam of six rows of stitching gives the ball a number of unique aerodynamic qualities, and helps determine its swing, cut and spin.</b></li>
